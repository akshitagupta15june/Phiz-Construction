Face as a biometric identification in computer vision is an important medium, in areas such as
video surveillance
animation games
security
anti-terrorist has a very wide range of applications, creating vivid, strong visibility of 3d face model, now has become a challenging in the field of computer vision is one of the important topics.

Facial reconstruction means to develop a three dimensional structure of face using a two dimensional input and different restructuring techniques.

Using camera calibration, three-dimensional data of facial images are extracted using the functions of OpenCV computer vision library, and then 3d face models are reconstructed.
